          Hello! Thank you for viewing my portfolio. I’m a passionate, front-end
          developer based in Orlando, transitioning my way into the tech
          industry from hospitality.
          <br />
          <br />
          I decided to get into coding because I love the challenge, learning
          new things, and the satisfaction of seeing a finished product,
          something I feel the hospitality industry lacked. So, I started
          learning on Codecademy where I went through their Front-End Engineer
          career path, earning a certificate and focusing on JavaScript and
          React. Feel free to check out my projects on
          <a href="https://github.com/MrStealurCar">GitHub</a> or connect with
          me on

            >LinkedIn!</a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          I recently started their Back-End Engineer career path as well where
          I'm currently focusing on Express and Postgres. However, I’m currently
          looking for front-end opportunities. My goal is to build a strong
          foundation in front-end development while continuously learning and
          growing, with the long-term goal of exploring more advanced areas such
          as software engineering.
